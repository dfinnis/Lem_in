algo problems: (probably in solve.c)
[] test2 we 38 them: 35
[] test3 we: 33 them: 32
[] test_big we: 34 (wrong) them: 52
[] test_big2 we: 103 (wrong) them: 110

>>>
some fixed, but still problems:
out4(test_big) and out5(test_big2) has dublicate paths...

DONE:
[] wrote aditional function to find the end - need to norm
[] modified solve

LEAKS:
[] sometimes indirectly lost, but seems to be in valgind:
- leak err_over_max_int
- leak err_over_max_long_long
- leak err_room name starts with 'L'
- leak err_too_many_ants_10000
- leak negative_coordinates
- leak test2.1
